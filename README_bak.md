## Introduction

A versatile and efficient codebase for many computer vision tasks: classification, segmentation, detection, self-supervised learning, keypoints and 3D, etc.

### Features

* **Clean & simple & flexible development**: When using detectron2, if you want to implement a new module such as CustomRetinanet, you need to register it to meta_arch, then specify in xxx_config.yaml, and you still need to esplicitly invoke 'from net import CustomRetinanet' to allow registry to retrieve your module successfully. It means you need to copy train_net.py from common tools directory and insert the line above;
* **Flexible and easy-to-use configuration system**: When add new config options in Detectron2, you need to add it into config/defaults.py first and then modify the config.yaml. But now in cvpods you just need to add to config.py once. When you need to debug a component, you may need to set SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH to 2, before you need to modify it in config, after it starts running correctly, you need to modify it to 16. That's unconvenient too. So â€‹cvpods allow you to dynamicly update config, for example: `pods_train --num-gpus 1 SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH 2`.
* **Task specific incremental updating.**: For example, if you need to modify Retinanet relative configurations, you just need to modify retinanet_config.py and don't need care other common configs. On the other hand, we avoid putting all kinds of methods' configuration all in one base config file(such as detectron2/config/defaults.py) like detectron2, maskrcnn_benchmark and mmdetection. So retinanet will not include ROI_HEADS, MASK_HEADS configurations, but only has all necessary component.
* **Efficient experiments management**: When you need to implement a new model, you can either copy a project from examples and inheritate some kind of networks such as RetinaNet of FasterRCNN, then define your custom functions; or you can add a new base / commonly used model(such as FCOS) into `cvpods/modeling/meta_arch' and using it like a library.
* **Versatile tasks & datasets support**:
  * Detection, Segmentation (Semantic, Panoptic, Instance), Keypoint, Self-supervised Learning, 3D Detection & Segmentation, etc.
  * COCO, Objects365, WiderFace, VOC, LVIS, CityPersons, ImageNet, CrowdHuman, CityScapes, ModelNet40, ScanNet, KITTI, nuScenes, etc.
* **Global training / testing scripts.**: you just need to invoke `pods_train/test --num-gpus x` in your playground; and your projects only need to include all project-specific configs and network modules.
* **Compatible with detectron2**: All models in detectron2 can be easily migrated into cvpods.
